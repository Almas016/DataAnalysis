    "## What is Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)?\n",
    "If we want to explain EDA in simple terms, it means trying to understand the given data much better, so that we can make some sense out of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can find a more formal definition in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "*In statistics, exploratory data analysis is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.*\n",
    "\n",
    "EDA in Python uses data visualization to draw meaningful patterns and insights. It also involves the preparation of data sets for analysis by removing irregularities in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the results of EDA, companies also make business decisions, which can have repercussions later.\n",
    "* If EDA is not done properly then it can hamper the further steps in the machine learning model building process.\n",
    "* If done well, it may improve the efficacy of everything we do next.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article we’ll see about the following topics:\n",
    "1. Data Sourcing\n",
    "2. Data Cleaning\n",
    "3. Univariate analysis\n",
    "4. Bivariate analysis\n",
    "5. Multivariate analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Data Sourcing\n",
    "Data Sourcing is the process of finding and loading the data into our system. Broadly there are two ways in which we can find data.\n",
    "1. Private Data\n",
    "2. Public Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise we will be using Publiccly available data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data Cleaning\n",
    "After completing the Data Sourcing, the next step in the process of EDA is Data Cleaning. It is very important to get rid of the irregularities and clean the data after sourcing it into our system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Irregularities are of different types of data.\n",
    "* Missing Values\n",
    "* Incorrect Format\n",
    "* Incorrect Headers\n",
    "* Anomalies/Outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform the data cleaning we are using a sample data set, which can be found in course Moodle page.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let’s import the necessary libraries and store the data in our system for analysis."
